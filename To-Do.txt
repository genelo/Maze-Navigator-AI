still working on code these are some of the things that need to be implemented

- sand and spider webs
	1.- assign costs

-agent
	1.- add a lookahead function 
	2.- possibly a function to determine where to go
	3.- detect obstacles
		-save obstacle position in a data structure and check for possible collision 
	4.- cost of movement and update
	5.- save movement in a data structure (stack?) to backtrack if needed
		- implement backtracking function
- algorithm
	1.- code algorithm for agent


not so important

-graph 
	1.-graph spider web correctly
